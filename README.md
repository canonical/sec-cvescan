## About

CVEScan analyzes an Ubuntu system to check whether all available security
patches have been installed. CVEScan produces a clear, concise report that
tells you which, if any, security patches an Ubuntu system may be missing.

In addition to scanning a local system, CVEScan can [scan a package
manifest](#generating-and-scanning-a-manifest-file) file. This is useful in
environments where CVEScan cannot be installed on every system.

### Ubuntu Vulnerability Database JSON

The Ubuntu Security Team at Canonical regularly publishes a JSON file
containing information about security updates for `.deb` packages. The source of
the information is the [Ubuntu CVE
Tracker](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/). The information
contained in the JSON file is similar to the information published in the
[Ubuntu OVAL files](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/oval/), but
the format is designed specifically for use by CVEScan.

### Regarding v2.0.0 and Later
v2.0.0 is a complete rewrite of CVEScan. It boasts a clear, concise reporting
format and a 10x performance improvement over v1.0.10. Additionally, this
rewrite will allow developers to add new features and capabilities more
quickly.

The v1.0.10 version of CVEScan has been removed from this repository and the
resulting snap package as of v3.0.0.

For more information about how v2.0.0 differs from v1.0.10, see the
[CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).

                        scan a package manifest file instead of the local system
                        (use '-' to read from stdin)
  --csv                 format output as CSV
  --json                format output as JSON
  --syslog HOST:PORT    send JSON formatted output to a syslog server specified by
                        <host>:<port>
  --syslog-light HOST:PORT
                        send a simple log message to a syslog server specified by
                        <host>:<port>
  --show-links          include links to the Ubuntu CVE Tracker in the output
  --unresolved          include CVEs that have not yet been resolved in the output
  -x, --experimental    for users of Ubuntu Advantage, include eXperimental (also
                        called "alpha") in the output
  -n, --nagios          format output for use with Nagios NRPE
  -c CVE-IDENTIFIER, --cve CVE-IDENTIFIER
                        report whether or not this system is vulnerable to a
                        specific CVE.
  -s, --silent          do not print any output (only used with --cve)
```

### Return Codes

In general, CVEScan's return codes indicate the following:

| Return Code | Description|
| :---: | --- |
|0| The scan was successful and no CVEs affect this system.|
|1| An error occurred.|
|2| Invalid CLI options were specified.|
|3| The system is vulnerable to one or more CVEs.|
|4| The system is vulnerable to one or more CVEs and one or more patches are available.|

When the `--nagios` option is specified, CVEScan's return codes indicate the following:

| Return Code | Description|
| :---: | --- |
|0| The scan was successful and no CVEs affect this system.|
|1| The system is vulnerable to one or more CVEs.|
|2| The system is vulnerable to one or more CVEs and one or more patches are available OR invalid CLI options were specified.|
|3| An error occurred.|

### Generating and Scanning a Manifest File

In addition to scanning a local system, CVEScan can scan a package manifest
file. This is useful in environments where CVEScan cannot be installed on every
system. After a manifest file has been generated, it can be copied to any
system where CVEScan is installed and scanned with `cvescan -m MANIFEST_FILE`.

Manifests can also be read from stdin. For example,
`dpkg-query -W | cvescan -m -`

There are a few ways to generate manifest files, each with their own pros and
cons.

#### Bare-bones Manifest Generation Method

A package manifest file can be generated by running `dpkg-query -W >
manifest.txt` on any Ubuntu system. This method requires that
`update-manager-core` is installed on the system (it is by default in most
installations).

#### Preferred Manifest Generation Method

The preferred way to generate manifest files is to run
`cvescan.dump-dpkg-manifest` if you've installed the snap, or download and run
the
[dump_dpkg_manifest.sh](https://github.com/canonical/sec-cvescan/blob/master/dump_dpkg_manifest.sh)
script. This method is preferred for 2 reasons:

1. In the future, the format of manifest files that is expected by CVEScan will
   change. While CVEScan will make every effort to remain backwards compatible,
   backwards compatibility is not guaranteed. Furthermore, changes to the
   manifest file format will improve the accuracy and relevancy of CVEScan
   results. Running this script insulates administrators from changes to how
   manifest files are generated.
2. This method explicitly adds the Ubuntu release codename to the top of the
   manifest file. This is required when generating manifest files on systems
   where `update-manager-core` is not installed.

If you are unable to use the dump_dpkg_manifest.sh script, the following
one-liner can be added to a cron job or run by any other mechanism to produce a
manifest file on systems where `update-manager-core` is not installed:

```
(source /etc/lsb-release && echo $DISTRIB_CODENAME && dpkg-query -W) > manifest.txt
```

## Installation

### As a Snap

The recommended way to install CVEScan is with `sudo snap install cvescan`

### From Source

#### Install in local environment
The following commands will install and run CVEScan from source:

```bash
    $> sudo apt install python3-pip
    $> git clone https://github.com/canonical/sec-cvescan
    $> pip3 install --user ./sec-cvescan/
    $> ~/.local/bin/cvescan
```

#### Install in a virtual environment
The following commands will install and run CVEScan from source in a python virtual environment:

```bash
    $> sudo apt install python3-pip git
    $> pip3 install --user virtualenv
    $> git clone https://github.com/canonical/sec-cvescan
    $> ~/.local/bin/virtualenv -p python3 venv
    $> source venv/bin/activate
    $> pip3 install -e ./sec-cvescan[apt]
    $> venv/bin/cvescan
```

## Development

### Running from Source

CVEScan can be run from the source code with `python3 -m cvescan`

### Installing pre-commit hooks

To install the pre-commit hooks, run

```bash
    $> pip3 install --user pre-commit
    $> ~/.local/bin/pre-commit install
```

### Running the test suite

You can run the automated test suite by running

```bash
    $> python3 setup.py test
```

An HTML code coverage report will be generated at `./htmlcov`. You can view
this with any web browser (e.g. `Firefox ./htmlcov/index.html`).

### Version numbers
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The version number used by the `setup.py`, `snapcraft.yaml`, and `cvescan
--version` argument is stored in [cvescan/version.py](./cvescan/version.py) and
must be updated manually when a new version of CVEScan is released.
